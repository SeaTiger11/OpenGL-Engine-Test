# OpenGL Engine Test

## Why was it created?
This project was created with the intent of applying to different internship programs and to further development my general c++ skills as well as to learn how to create and manage a game engine.

## What was the end goal
The end goal of this project was to create a fully functional 3d game based off titanfall 2 movement mechanics. This would include everything from 3d rendering, a physics based player controller, enemy ai (based on a flow field varient which uses a 3d flood fill and a boid system to control a drone swarm as the enemies), a collision detection and response (was going to use gjk and epa).  

## Current stage of development
The engine can currently render 3d objects and has a simplistic physics based player controller. Furthermore it's capable of importing gltf models with vertex colours and was previously capable of running textures however the texture importing is currently broken and textures are bugged. Lastly the engine has a UI system that's currently in development which allows designers to quickly iterate UI systems in a simple scripting system based off CSS. 
Currently the engine still lacks the collision detection and response as well as the intended AI systems and a sufficently advanced player controller. However, for now this engine will stay at this stage of development as I've made the decision that I wish to continue development with Vulkan instead of OpenGL and will try to restart development from the start. This choice was made due to believing that vulkan is more suitable to learn in the current industry and ultimatly this project was designed to learn relevant game engine programming techniques and skills.
