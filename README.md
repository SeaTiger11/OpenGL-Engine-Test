# Respawn Entertainment Application Project

## Why was it created?
This project was created with the intent of applying to Respawn's internship program after the realisation that I had a lack of suitable code that showed my up to date experience and expertise. 

## What is the end goal
The end goal of the project is to create a fully functional 3d game with titanfall 2 style movement mechanics (still shocked I forgot titanfall on my resume under favourite games). For this to happen, I intend on creating a physics system to allow for wall riding, jumping, double jumping ect. The project will also feature simple enemies with basic AI. I will attempt to add a 3d varient of the flow field pathfinding algorithm which relies on flood fill. It will be used with drone's running a boid system to create a drone swarm enemy type. (This is just a concept at the moment as I only recently designed the varient and am yet to test it).
In addition, once the base mechanics have been set up, controller support will also be integrated to showcase my capabilites in creating cross platfrom applications.

(If possible, leaving my portfolio and application for last would be greatly apprecieated so that I can further the development of this project)

# TEMPORARY UNTIL NEXT COMMIT
As a progress update due to lack of commits I will summarise what's been happening due to lack of clear code updates.
Between a few days of long hours at work (12+ hours) and a recent sickness, I've been unable to progress much on the actual code development however I've been doing research in the mean time.
I've researched:
-AABB
-OBB
-GJK + EPA
-SAT
-BSP Trees
-Best practises for UI tool development

Furthermore I've began reading "Real-Time Collision Detection" by Christer Ericson and planned out the flow field varient as well numerous optimisations where one of the steps can even be used for broad phase collision detection against static colliders.
